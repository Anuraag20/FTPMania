### Docs

**Note:** Update Readme and Changelog - docs related release

# [2.1.0](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/compare/react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.5...react-countdown-circle-timer@2.1.0) (2020-04-28)

### Features

- **web:** pass totalElapsedTime as an argument to onComplete callback ([dfd33ce](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/commit/dfd33ce05431c43540f384bbd554e14f620e28af))

`onComplete` callback will receive as an argument the `totalElapsedTime` in seconds. This is the total duration since the countdown has started running. It's mainly used when the countdown is repeated and the total duration has to be known. Example: countdown of days, hours, minutes and seconds.

## [2.0.5](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/compare/react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.4...react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.5) (2020-04-27)

### Chore

**Note:** Upgrade use-elapsed-time package to v1.2.1, which passes totalElapsedTime in the onComplete callback

## [2.0.4](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/compare/react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.3...react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.4) (2020-04-23)

### Chore

**Note:** Update Readme to reflect all change since the repo is a monorepo and update use cases in Readme

## [2.0.3](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/compare/react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.2...react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.3) (2020-04-23)

### Hot fix

Local Lerna package was added as "dependencies" instead of "devDependencies" causing installation problems of the package

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/vydimitrov/react-countdown-circle-timer/compare/react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.1...react-countdown-circle-timer@2.0.2) (2020-04-23)

### Hot fix

An attempt to fix broken installation by remove "publishConfig" from package.json

## [2.0.1](2020-04-23)

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Make the repo monorepo handled by Lerna
- Breaking changes:
  - Remove the old `startAt` prop. The recommended prop to use is `initialRemainingTime` instead.
  - Remove `margin` styles from the wrapper and all svg styles
  - `durationSeconds` is renamed to just `duration`. The duration is still in **seconds**
  - `renderTime` prop is now deprecated. React `children` should be used instead. The `children` prop accepts a render function or a component where `remainingTime` and `elapsedTime` are passed as props.
  - `renderAriaTime` prop will receive as an argument an object with the `remainingTime` and `elapsedTime`

## [2.0.0](-)
